# 100-days-of-code-journal
A modified version of the progress of 100 days of code challenge

## Day 1: 2 July 2018

**Today's Progress** : Started Learning React, Learned how to think in components, Created a CRUD app(using state and api integration). Created a backend api server using DRF.

**Thoughts** : I simplified the learning by first creating totally state managed application in react and then adding api integration.

## Day 2: 3 July 2018

**Today's Progress** : Added bootstrap in todo app frontend. Setup JWT based authentication in todo app backend. Created authentication (Login/Signup) using JWT.

**Thoughts** : Followed this [tutorial](https://medium.com/@dakota.lillie/django-react-jwt-authentication-5015ee00ef9a) to implement JWT based authentication in Django and react. Next step would be to integrate this in todo app frontend.

## Day 3: 4 July 2018

**Today's Progress** : Created Github user info application.

**Thoughts** : Needs more work on the UI side. Some props were not properly passed to Card. Will pick this up tomorrow. Also need to refactor UI for authentication app.
