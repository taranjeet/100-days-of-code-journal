# 100-days-of-code-journal
A modified version of the progress of 100 days of code challenge

## Day 1: 2 July 2018

**Today's Progress** : Started Learning React, Learned how to think in components, Created a CRUD app(using state and api integration). Created a backend api server using DRF.

**Thoughts** : I simplified the learning by first creating totally state managed application in react and then adding api integration.
